In this repository, there are two python notebook files, each of which contains half the assignment and its relevant instructions.

Starting with PS1_Reviews, please complete the two files according to the instructions in each of them. 

The easiest option is to click on the button to open and run the notebooks on Google Colab. Note that in order to save your edits to these files, you may need to use the "Save as copy in github" command in Google Colab, in the File menu.

You may also edit and run the notebooks locally and push your changes with git.
